made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , MST , union-find

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Exactly same with MST algorithm.

Use priority_queue to select minimum weight edge and if it is not connected (use union-find) , add the weight and union.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
